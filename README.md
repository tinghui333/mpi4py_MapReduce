# mpi4py_MapReduce
This is the project 1 from the graduate course Big Data Analysis in Stony Brook University.
The aim is to build up a map-reduce algorithm using MPI in Python.

## Counting the hihest frequencies number
There are 20 files. Each contains about 1.5 millions integers ranging from 0-100. We'd need to use the map-reduce algorithm to collect and find the top 5 integers with the highest frequencies.


## Enivorinment
* We were building and testing the MPI code in [Seawulf](https://it.stonybrook.edu/help/kb/understanding-seawulf)
* 4 processes were used in both mapper and reducers
